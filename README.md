# Muenzkabinett

This is the codebase for the ["Coins"](https://uclab.fh-potsdam.de/coins/) project that was created during a the "Visualising cultural collections" course with Marian DÃ¶rk at FH Potsdam. 

As a databasis, the application uses a [LIDO](http://network.icom.museum/cidoc/working-groups/lido/what-is-lido/) XML export. Essential coin attributes as well as images are extracted from the heavy XML files and written to a CSV which is the basis for the browser application.
